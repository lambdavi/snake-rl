# snake-rl: Reinforcement Learning applied to Snake

### Files in the directory:
- snake_game.py: is used to play the standard version of game.
- snake_game_ai.py: contains the class SnakeGameAI controlled by the Agent.

### TODOs
- improving skeleton of the project
- include args to hyperparameters choice
- correct behaviour of collapsing of the snake (maybe including diagonal informatin)
- maybe: improve general working using cnn over entire field?
